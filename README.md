PART 3:
In this section, I resolved a merge conflict in the index.html file after modifying it in a feature branch named feat-body-text. I pushed my changes to GitHub, then created a conflict by altering the same section of the file directly on GitHub. Upon attempting to pull the latest changes, I encountered conflict markers in VSCode. I used the merge editor to combine both changes and resolved the conflict. Finally, I committed the resolved file and pushed the updates back to the remote repository.
part 4:
In this section, I describe the pull request (PR) workflow used to merge changes into the main branch. First, I created a new branch for my feature and pushed my changes to the remote repository on GitHub. I then initiated a pull request, providing a title and description to explain the changes made.

Once the PR was created, team members reviewed the changes, leaving comments and suggesting modifications if necessary. After the review process, the PR was approved, allowing me to merge it into the main branch. Finally, I had the option to delete the branch post-merge, keeping the repository organized.
